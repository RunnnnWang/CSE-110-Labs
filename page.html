    <p>With approximately 10,000 students in every incoming class, we wanted a way to make your university experience feel more personal and approachable. As a UC San Diego undergraduate, you’ll be assigned to one of the university’s colleges, each with its own general education curriculum, support services, residential neighborhood, and distinctive traditions.

        If you’re a first-year student, you’ll likely live at your college or in one of our other dynamic undergraduate communities. If you’re an incoming transfer student, you will have the option to live on campus in a transfer student centered living-learning community.
        
        We do things a little differently than other universities, so you'll be free to pursue your chosen major no matter which college you attend. This approach gives you the unique opportunity to live and study alongside people with diverse interests, backgrounds and educational paths.</p>

            <p>John Muir College, the second undergraduate college at UCSD, is named after John Muir, the environmentalist, writer, founder of the Sierra Club. While we do not have an academic requirement that students study the environment, we do include environmental issues in the college, Our motto, "celebrating the independent spirit" is inspired by Muir's life, travels, and political activism to change the fabric of the nation.
            Muir College is built on Mat kulaaxuuy in the unceded territory of the Kumeyaay Nation. We acknowledge the eighteen American Indian tribes of this territory - including the Kumeyaay, Payómkawichum, Cupeño and Cahuilla - as well as the many Indigenous communities from the Americas and the Pacific who call San Diego home, and whose relations exist beyond colonization. We acknowledge that the Kumeyaay lands stretch beyond the present-day US Mexico border, including Kumiai village communities in Baja California, Mexico. We commit to building good relationships with the Native peoples of these lands.</p>
